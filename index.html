		<p class="indepth">Argentina’s Mauricio Macri assumed the presidency on December 10, 2015, following twelve years of rule by Presidents Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. At the outset, the Macri government found an economy mired in low growth and a country largely disconnected from the world. The series of reforms that the Macri government initiated were aimed at reintegrating Argentina into the world and producing economic growth, stability and predictability for citizens and investors alike.</p>

		<p class="indepth">The following scorecard is a list of the most significant reforms being planned and executed by the Macri government. We hope this summary helps to deepen understanding of the choices that are on the table and demonstrates that reform processes are incremental, as each reform moves forward at its own pace. This scorecard will be updated monthly as we see tangible progress on individual reforms. The current status of the reform can be found on the back of the corresponding card. We welcome your comments and feedback, as no such accounting of reforms can ever be complete.</p>
